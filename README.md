First project for CompSci 308 Fall 2016

## Name: Ben Linde
####Dates: Started September 1, Completed September 11
#### Hours Worked: ~25
## Resources Used: 
1. https://carlfx.wordpress.com/2012/03/29/javafx-2-gametutorial-part-1/
2. http://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/articles/gamedev-glossary-what-is-the-game-loop--gamedev-2469
3. JavaFX documentation on docs.oracle.com
4. example_javafx program forked from GitLab

#### File Used to Start And Test Project: main.java

## Possible Bugs:
Occasionally, with repeated play of the game, the enemies will begin to move faster and faster. Additionally, with repeated play, the first level (Asty.java) does not always initialize properly if it has been played repeatedly. After much testing, those seem to be the only two bugs.

## Information about Playing:
Arrow keys to move, space to shoot. Get rid of all enemies (red rectangles) to move on.

## Cheat Keys:  
Click behind Welcome on Splash Screen to slow down enemies  
Click bottom right corner of Splash Screen to skip to Level Two  

## Impressions of Assignment:
Overall, I thought this was a good first assignment. It gave me a great idea of all the standard design and implementation ideas of the class, and it was a great way for me to refresh my coding memory. However, I thought there should have been more time allotted in class to learning about and asking questions about JavaFX, because although I've been coding in Java for many years, I have not used JavaFX to create an application. I suppose part of the point of that is to make each student more independent, but I think there should still be more guidance, to prevent students from going in the complete wrong direction for their project.
