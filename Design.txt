Genre: MultiDirectional Shooter - like Asteroid
Name: Asty's Rescue
Backstory: The main character of the game is an Astronaut named Asty, who, 
while on his most recent mission, lost his girlfriend in the middle of space. 
He thinks that some Martians are behind it, so decides to launch a one man attack 
on the Martians to get his girlfriend back. 
Goal: The goal is to get back the levels of Martian attack to reach Asty's girlfriend. 
The levels differ because the Martian attacks get more and more complicated-they start
 out very simple, coming from only one direction, but by the end, the attack is 
 coming from all around.
